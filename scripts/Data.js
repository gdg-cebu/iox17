Technology is nothing new to me because 2 years after dabbling in an Accountancy career, I have found myself taking the road less traveled among my peers. I have been interested in systems accounting and that’s what got me to work in Technology with a Software Development company for a decade as a Business Systems Analyst and a QA Tester. I eventually shifted my career to Project Management and that’s where I began my journey in Accenture as an experienced hire 5 years ago. Since then, I have worked in projects from various Industry Groups: CIO, Health & Public Service, and recently in Digital. My recent projects in Accenture have been very challenging, but equally exciting as a Project Manager. Last year, I completed a Systems Integration roll-out of an Insurance Rewards system for the Asia Pacific region partnering with local and big insurance companies including the Philippines. My recent project is with Digital involving a global E-commerce web roll-out for an global Electronics company",
